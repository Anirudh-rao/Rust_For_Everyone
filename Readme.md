##  Rust For Everyone
The Rust programming language helps you write faster,
more reliable software. High-level ergonomics
and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict.
Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a
great developer experience, Rust gives you the option
to control low-level details (such as memory usage)
without all the hassle traditionally associated with
such control

### Who Rust Is For
Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let’s look at a few of
the most important groups.

### Teams of Developers

Rust is proving to be a productive tool for collaboration among large teams of
developers with varying levels of systems programming knowledge. Low-level
code is prone to a variety of subtle bugs, which in most other languages can
be caught only through extensive testing and careful code review by experienced developers. In Rust, the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to
compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs. By working alongside the compiler, the team can spend their time focusing on the
program’s logic rather than chasing down bugs.
Rust also brings contemporary developer tools to the systems programming world:

•	 Cargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes adding,
compiling, and managing dependencies painless and consistent across
the Rust ecosystem.

•	 Rustfmt ensures a consistent coding style across developers.

•	 The Rust Language Server powers Integrated Development Environment.
(IDE) integration for code completion and inline error messages.
By using these and other tools in the Rust ecosystem, developers can be
productive while writing systems-level code.
