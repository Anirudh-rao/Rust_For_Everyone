# Commmon Concepts in Rust:

This chapter covers concepts that appear in
almost every programming language and
how they work in Rust. Many programming
languages have much in common at their core.
None of the concepts presented in this chapter are
unique to Rust, but weâ€™ll discuss them in the context
of Rust and explain the conventions around using
these concepts.
